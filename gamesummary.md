# Mental Games (Temp. Name) Summary

The player is a tank, and starts the game with three lifes and three action points. 

HEARTS:
    This is pretty straight-forward, if you get shot by a tank, you lose a heart. Lose three hearts,
    and you are out of the game.

ACTION POINTS:
    Action points allow you to do actions. The actions are:

        - Moving 
        - Shooting
        - Upgrading Range
    
    When you do an action, you lose an action point. If you have no more action points, you can no 
    longer do any actions until you get more. 

RANGE:
    The range is where you can shoot people or give people action points. There are 3 levels 
    of range, each level having a bigger range then the last. Upgrading your range will result
    in you losing one action point.


At the end of everyday, each player will get one action point. Player can also get action points
if players give them the action points. 

GIVING:
    Players are able to give other players which are in their range
