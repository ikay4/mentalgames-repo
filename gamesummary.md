# Mentality Summary
update 5/17/23

The player is a tank(?), and starts the game with three lifes and three action points. 

HEARTS:
    This is pretty straight-forward, if you get shot by a tank, you lose a heart. Lose three hearts,
    and you are out of the game.

ACTION POINTS:
    When you do an action, you lose an action point. If you have no more action points, you can no 
    longer do any actions until you get more. 
    Action points allow you to do actions. The actions are:

        - Moving 
        - Shooting
        - Upgrading Range

RANGE:
    The range is where you can shoot people or give people action points. There are 3 levels 
    of range, each level having a bigger range then the last. Upgrading your range will result
    in you losing one action point.


At the end of everyday (every 24hr), each player will get one action point. Player can also get action points
if players give them the action points. 

GIVING:
    Players are able to give other players which are in their range their action points. There is
    no limit to how many action points a player could have to multiple players can give all their
    action points to a single person.


When a player is eliminated, they become part of the JURY.

JURY:
    Once a player is killed, they become part of the JURY. The JURY can see everything that is going on.
    Everyday, the jury can vote on which player they like the most/want to win. If a player gets 3 jury
    votes, they get an extra action point.

Final 2:
    Once the game reaches the final 2 players and the last 2 players cannot kill each other, the JURY
    gets to vote on which player they want to win. Player with most JURY votes wins the game.


NOTE: This game is suppose to last several days/weeks

CHAT (UNDECIDED):
    When a player is in game, the player can talk to (A) everyone in their range or (B) everyone near them
    in a set range, which cannot be upgraded or (C) everyone in game. It will not be team chats and every chat will be a 1 on 1 chat with just the player and the other player talking to each other. The JURY can see every chat, but the players can only see their chats. (this will be hard to add -.-)

    Please tell ikay which one you like best. Having a hard time deciding -.-
